## Overview
The Liverpool University Course Collector program uses a web scraper to collect information on all postgraduate taught master's programs offered by the University of Liverpool. The information collected includes the course name, description, and any other relevant details. The program saves the information as CSV files, making it easier for students to search and compare different courses.

## How to Run
To run the Liverpool University Course Collector program, you will need to have a recent version of [Go](https://golang.org/) installed on your computer. Once you have Go installed, you can run the program by cloning the repository and using the following command in your terminal:

    go run ./

The program will create a directory named `artifacts` in the current directory and save the CSV files of the course information in that directory.
