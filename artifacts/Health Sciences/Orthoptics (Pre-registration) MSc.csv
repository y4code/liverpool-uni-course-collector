"
Ophthalmology and Optics II ,(ORTH423),Compulsory modules,M,20,Whole Session,0:100,"To equip the student to use refractive techniques in screening and the verification of spectacle prescriptions and impart sufficient knowledge of the refractive error to allow effective interdisciplinary communication.
To critically appraise the range of orthoptic specialist/advanced/extended roles and the policies that influence these areas of clinical practice.
The module also aims to support the student&#39;s development toward their career in orthoptics  and to illustrate the importance of an inter-disciplinary approach in the management of patients presenting to the Ophthalmologist, Orthoptist and other health care professionals.
","(3) Evaluate the principles and methods of correction of refractive defects and prescribing optical corrections for a range of patients and conditions.
(M1) Evaluate the basic principles of retinoscopy to measure objective refraction and complete subjective refraction to refine measurement of refractive error.
(M2) Critially interpret anatomical structures by performing posterior eye examination with slit lamp biomicroscopy.
(M3) Evaluate the principles and methods of correction of refractive defects and prescribing optical corrections for a range of patients and conditions.
(M4) Appraise effective interprofessional (or collaborative) working in ophthalmic, health, and social care.
(M5) Critically evaluate ethical, legal, and NHS Frameworks/Policy relevant to developing and enhancing specialist, advanced, or extended orthoptic practice.
(S1) Communication Skills - developed through the practical sessions when learning how to refract and undertake ophthalmological examinations
(S2) Teamwork - as part of their tutorials they will learn about the multidisciplinary team/interdisciplinary working
(S3) Ethical Awareness - through the use of NHS policy and frameworks, students will understand ethical principles and conduct
(S4) Academic Writing - the assignment will allow students to develop their academic writing skills
