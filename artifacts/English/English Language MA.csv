Analysing Language: Tradition and Technique ,(ENGL698),Compulsory modules,M,15,First Semester,0:100,"On this module, students will acquire a thorough understanding of the major influences that have shaped the current field of language and linguistics.  They will appreciate how the discipline has evolved and will develop sufficient knowledge of this evolution to be able to position against it their own work. Delivering a comprehensive overview of the major traditions of linguistic analysis, the module pays particular attention to the origins of modern pragmatics and discourse analysis, focussing on key thinkers like Grice, Searle and Austin. It also incorporates developments that intersect with the work of critical theorists and social philosophers like Gadamer, Foucault and Habermas. The module covers developments in cognitive linguistics and considers the way these developments have intersected with differing methods in discourse analysis. Running throughout the module is a focus on the theme of ‘truth’ in linguistic analysis and on the origins of the study of both meaning and thought in language. This theme leads naturally to contemporary socio-cultural perceptions of the language of ‘post truth’ and its manifestation in the public sphere.

Students will also obtain a solid grounding in the concept of language as Social Semiotic while another aim of the module is to enable students to employ the key principles of functional linguistics in their own textual analyses. To this extent, and as is consistent with this tradition in linguistics, the analytic skills imparted in FL are transferable and can be brought to bear on many types of data.
