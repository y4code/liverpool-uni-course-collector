Principles of Human Anatomy ,(HARC701),Compulsory modules,M,15,Second Semester,40:60,"This module aims to:
•	Enhance the breadth and depth of learner’s existing anatomical knowledge in order to evaluate the relationship between structure and function at the microscopic, macroscopic and system levels.
•	Develop learner’s ability to correctly select, use and analyse anatomical terminology to discuss body structures and interrogate their significance and relationships with each other.
•	Enable critical and comparative appraisal of the relationship between structure and function throughout various stages of development.
•	Prepare learners for more advanced or specialist modules later in their programme.
","(LO1) Identify and critically appraise structure and organisation in the human body using anatomical terminology to determine relations, position and movement.
(LO2) Critically evaluate the relationship between structure and function within the human body and compare this at the cellular, tissue, organ and system levels.
(LO3) Assess, appraise and describe the key gross and functional anatomy of each major body system.
(LO4) Assess and critically evaluate the structural changes in key body structures throughout their development to distinguish between embryonic, fetal, juvenile and adult anatomy.
(S1) Communicate anatomical knowledge effectively and confidently, presenting ideas orally and in writing.
(S2) Apply principles of ethics and professionalism towards human material.
(S3) Engage in critical enquiry through independent learning for continuing professional development.
(S4) Digital fluency in a technology enhanced learning environment.
"
Anatomical Education ,(HARC702),Compulsory modules,M,15,Second Semester,0:100,"•	To enable learners to explore and evaluate theoretical and practical aspects of pedagogy in anatomy which will inform the development of a personal teaching approach. 
•	To enable learners to develop the skills and confidence necessary to effectively design and deliver anatomical educational experiences that address all aspects of the learning process.
","(LO1) Critically evaluate pedagogical principles and their application to teaching practices in anatomy.
(LO2) Apply educational theories and practices used in anatomical curricula to the design and implementation of an original teaching activity.
(LO3) Critically reflect on individual performance following an original teaching activity to inform the progression of a personal teaching approach.
(S1) Confidently communicate anatomical knowledge to teach an audience.
(S2) Select and appraise relevant anatomical and pedagogical literature.
(S3) Reflect on and evaluate own performance to modify future practice.
"
Clinically Applied Anatomy ,(HARC703),Compulsory modules,M,30,Whole Session,50:50,"This module aims:
•	To enable learners to acquire and evaluate advanced knowledge independently which expands and contextualises their existing appreciation of the relationship between structure and function.
•	To develop in learners the critical analytical skills to explain the significance and clinical implications of anatomical variations, abnormalities and pathologies.
•	To enable learners to explore and critique the anatomical basis for the selection and use of equipment in a variety of clinical situations.
•	To enable learners to develop their confidence and communication skills by communicating complex anatomical information in a variety of ways.
","(PGCert1) Compare and contrast through critical evaluation, the structure and function of normal and abnormal human anatomical systems and their interactions.
(PGCert2) Identify variations in human anatomy and critically appraise their potential significance to function in health and disease.
(PGCert3) Critically evaluate the role of anatomy in the structural and functional causes of injury, trauma and disease.
(PGCert4) Critically assess the application of anatomical studies to modern clinical practices.
(PGCert5) Critically appraise the relevance of modern clinical diagnostic methods in anatomy and healthcare and their relevance to clinical practice.
(S1) Identify own learning needs and means to achieve them.
(S2) Apply knowledge and theoretical experience gained online to practical situations in laboratory conditions, including with cadaveric tissue.
(S3) Communicate anatomical knowledge confidently in a variety of ways.
