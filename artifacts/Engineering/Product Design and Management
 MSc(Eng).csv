Product Modelling & VIrtual Reality ,(MNFG608),Compulsory modules,M,15,Second Semester,0:100,"Welcome to Product Modelling &amp; VR.
This module provides a continuance to the subjects and topics covered in Product Design 1 and an opportunity to apply them to a detailed project. This module also includes an overview and introduction to the area of modelling and virtual reality in design on a practical level. During the next 24 weeks, modelling and simulation will be examined, discussed and analysed by relating theories to practice in a 12 week lonh product design and development project.
Students will examine what it takes to bring a new product off the drawing board, through virtual development, and into a modern pre-tooling &#39;pre-sales&#39; promotional environment. Students will also be encouraged to examine how this process is inextricably linked to achieving success in the development of new products.
Students will learn:
Through Discussion: Perhaps the most important mechanism, discussion involves everyone. Moreover, without discussion, we cannot identify that you have grasped the basic principles. Sharing is an important learning mechanism. Do it often.
Through Written Assignments: Written assignments help us to look at you individually. You can sometimes “hide” in the group, but with individual written assignments, we are able to judge your compliance with learning outcomes and see where you have strengths and weaknesses.
Through Group and/or Individual Projects: These facilitate teamwork, critical thinking, decision making, and enhance organizational skills. Modelling and virtual reality (particularly thanks to the development and incorporation of Web3D facilities into the global design arena) is a growing and highly researched area within current design education and practice.
The development of exceptional design modelling and virtual reality skills will become increasingly crucial to sustaining economic growth in the dynamic global economy in the not too distant future.
The ability to leading design and simulation tools is now considered key to long-term organizational success - it is a new strategic weapon. Students nearing graduation must therefore learn the keys to this approach in order to become effective managers in the 21st Century. Once managers adopt a posture which includes these modern tools and techniques, they will be able to better deliver true market opportunities and exploit those opportunities with speed and confidence.
