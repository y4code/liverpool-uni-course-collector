The module aims to explore the behaviours of these &#39;Neolithic&#39; communities across the Near East and Europe. We will question when these phenomena appeared, why they might have appeared and how human societies responded to their new opportunities and pressures;
The module aims to examine how much distinctive ritual practices, art, new forms of identity and new sorts of engagements with their landscapes characterized these communities. The West Eurasia scope of the module will provide and opportunity to see how much Neolithic behaviour varied as it first developed and then spread from the Near East (SW Asia) into Europe;
The module will identify key themes in current research into the Neolithic and provide students some choice about the themes upon which we will focus.

"Researching Urban Communities in the Near East, 5000-500 B.c ",(ALGY646),Optional modules,M,15,Second Semester,0:100,"The nature and development of urban communities are issues central to an understanding of modern day life. Throughout the module it is intended that students will examine concepts of urbanism in an advanced fashion. Students will also engage in critical evaluation of research strategies and analytical approaches that allow us to appreciate the development and nature of early urban communities in the Near East through the archaeological and textual record. By 3000 BC the Near East had witnessed the appearance of the world&#39;s first cities and states.  This module investigates concepts and analytical methods suited to the analysis of these early cities on the basis of archaeological evidence.
In particular, this module aims to go beyond the traditional archaeological focus on external catalysts for initial urbanisation and look instead at the relations that constitute cities and how these might be both reflected in and shaped by the forms, layouts, and structures of urban settlements. This aim requires students to grasp core concepts regarding the spatial organisation of cities;
To appreciate the problems and potential of both the available archaeological and textual data; 
To develop a critical analytical sense of how primary archaeological examples might be analysed in order to form arguments regarding the nature, form and development of cities in the ancient Near East; 
To learn to utilise key tools, especially software, designed to facilitate the spatial analysis of archaeological site plans.
","(LO1) Students successfully completing the module will achieve an understanding of key research issues in Near Eastern archaeology and studies of urbanism.
