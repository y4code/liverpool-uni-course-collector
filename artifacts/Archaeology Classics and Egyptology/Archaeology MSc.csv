Students will also gain a working knowledge of the main analytical techniques used in the analysis of archaeological material and how to chose appropriate techniques to address specific types of question; 
Basic introductory instruction will be given in the main types of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and in chemical analysis of artefacts; 
A central theme of the module is that, while the scientific study of archaeological artefacts can be used to address cultural and historical questions, that study has to be approached from within a firm archaeological context. Furthermore, the data generated by that study need then to be interpreted within the appropriate cultural framework, with as broad an understanding as possible;
Artefacts from the Departmental study collections and Museum will be studied during the practical sessions and a practical project studying a variety of artefact types resulting in a detailed written report forms part of the final assessment.
","(LO1) Students who take this module should gain an understanding of the analytical techniques used to investigate archaeological artefacts.
(LO2) Students will gain some practical experience of the analysis of archaeological materials and a basic grasp of the skills set required to undertake this work.
(LO3) Students will understand the practical problems of sampling archaeological objects and their analysis, and the necessity of a fully contextualised interpretation.
(S1) Sampling, sample preparation, analytical and data analysis skills

"Pyrotechnology: Theory, Evidence and Experiment ",(ALGY740),Optional modules,M,15,First Semester,0:100,"To enable students to explore the role of pyrotechnology in human development, what pyrotechnology is, and how its many facets interrelate with contemporary social and technological systems;
To introduce students to some of the theoretical frameworks and ideas surrounding the harnessing of heat by humankind to modify and enhance the material world around them;
To consider how scientific methods can be used to understand pyrotechnological processes, to learn how these processes work and how they may have been understood in the past;
To gain basic practical experience/understanding of key pyrotechnologies and have the opportunity, through project work, to investigate questions about pyrotechnology through research in the library, laboratory and the field.
","(LO1) Students will gain an understanding of the nature of pyrotechnology and its importance to human development and of the main theoretical arguments about the interpretation of the current body of evidence.
(LO2) Students will gain a practical grounding in the skills required to identify, analyse and interpret pyrotechnological remains.
