Main Dissertation ,(MATH554),Compulsory modules,M,60,Whole Session,0:100,"The aim of the main dissertation is for the student, under guidance from his or her supervisor, to research a substantial mathematical topic thoroughly and write his or her own clear and coherent account of it.

The account may contain original material in the form of new examples or computations, full details of proofs only available in sketch form in the literature, or even new results or new proofs of known results.  There is no requirement to produce publishable original work, but the level of detail and depth of the material should be greater than in the preliminary dissertation. Indeed, it is common (although not necessary) for students to continue their preliminary dissertation work in the main dissertation, and to work with the same supervisor.  It is acceptable to summarise material from the preliminary dissertation in the main one, where this makes it more complete or coherent, provided that this material is clearly labelled as such. Of course, the mark for the main dissertation will be based only on the new material.
