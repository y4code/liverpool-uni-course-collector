Contesting Fictions: From Romance to the Novel ,(ENGL718),Optional modules,M,15,First Semester,0:100,"  This module aims to help students to develop an informed and sophisticated understanding of a selection of Renaissance and 18th-century works of fiction.  It allows for the detailed study of prose romances and tales from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and also of the version of ‘Romance’ most popular in the late eighteenth century: the ‘Gothic novel’, with which the period was especially fascinated.  Emphasis will be placed initially upon the history of prose fiction and the emergence of the ‘novel’ as a literary form, and the module will examine works by a number of writers from George Gascoigne and Thomas Nashe to Samuel Richardson and Ann Radcliffe.  It aims to address how prose narrative across both periods relates to issues of gender, identity, and the ‘self’ as well as the stuff of sensationalism, and it asks why, for example, ‘Romance’ and later the novel have traditionally been considered ‘feminine’ – and not always reputable – forms.  Students will be expected to familiarise themselves with relevant literary, cultural and historical contexts of the works examined. There will be guidance concerning useful contemporary critical material and contextual works.  By completion of the module, students should feel confident in developing critical readings of a selection of Renaissance and 18th-century fictions, set in appropriate contexts.
