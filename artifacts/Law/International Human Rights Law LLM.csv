Transitional Justice ,(LAW508),Optional modules,M,20,Second Semester,0:100,"Background: This module will introduce you to the area of law known as Transitional Justice and to provide an overview of the prevailing themes, issues and challenges faced within the field. The module will allow you to examine and critically assess the development and efficacy of various institutions and processes designed to deal with grave &amp; systematic human rights violations in countries which are in transition from conflict or repression to peace. We will study the fundamental concepts which underpin the idea of TJ, concepts such as truth, justice, peace and reconciliation as well as examining various transitional justice mechanisms such as international criminal law trials and tribunals, truth commissions, amnesties, reparations and local forms of justice. We will also investigate various contemporary challenges for the field in terms of theory and practice including, alternative conceptions of justice e.g. redistributive justice; economic, social and cultural rights; gender and overlaps with peacebuilding and development. We also explore the wider contextual factors within international relations that effect the choices made with regard to transitional justice – what actors are involved and why? Who controls the transitional justice agenda?  Due to the nature of transitional justice in the international community, it is necessary to approach this topic from an interdisciplinary perspective, and not only look at the law, but to discuss the way in which these rules operate in various contexts and societies.
